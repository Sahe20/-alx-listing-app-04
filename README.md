# ALX Listing App

## üè† Project Overview

The **ALX Listing App** will be a responsive Airbnb-style listing page that would be developed as part of my ALX ProDev program. I will build it using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, with a focus on modern frontend architecture, reusable components, and a clean, scalable codebase.

The goal of this project is to establish a solid foundation for real-world applications by implementing a clone of an Airbnb listing interface, including cards, filtering, and responsive design features.
